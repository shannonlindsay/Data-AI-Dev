	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image22.png)

### Review the report

In this task, you will review the pre-developed report.

1. In Power BI Desktop, review the report design.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image23.png)

	*The report page has a title and two visuals. The slicer visual allows filtering by a single fiscal year, while the bar chart visual displays monthly sales amounts. In this lab, you will improve the performance of the report by setting up incremental refresh and a hybrid table.*

### Review the data model

In this task, you will review the pre-developed data model.

1. Switch to **Model** view.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image24.png)

2. Use the model diagram to review the model design.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image25.png)

	*The model comprises five dimension tables and one fact table. Each table uses import storage mode. The **Sales** fact table represents sales order details. It's a classic star schema design.*

	*In this lab, you will set up the **Sales** table to use incremental refresh and become a hybrid table. A hybrid table includes a DirectQuery partition that represents the latest time period. That partition ensures current data from the data source is available in Power BI reports.*

## Set up incremental refresh

In this exercise, you will set up incremental refresh.

*Incremental refresh extends scheduled refresh operations by providing automated partition creation and management for dataset tables that frequently load new and updated data. It helps to reduce refresh time, placing lower burdens on source data and Power BI. It can also help surface current data to Power BI report more quickly.*

### Add parameters

In this task, you will add two parameters.

1. To open the Power Query Editor window, on the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Queries** group, click the **Transform data** icon.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image26.png)

2. In the Power Query Editor window, from inside the **Queries** pane, select the **Sales** query.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image27.png)

3. In the preview pane, notice the **OrderDate** column, which is a date/time column.

	*Incremental refresh requires that the table contain a date column of date/time or integer data type with the value formatted as yyyymmdd.*

	*To setup incremental refresh, you must create parameters that Power BI will use to filter this column to create table partitions.*

4. To create a parameter, on the **Home** ribbon tab, select the **Manager Parameters** icon.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image28.png)

5. In the **Manage Parameters** window, select **New**.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image29.png)

6. In the **Name** box, replace the text with **RangeStart**.

7. In the **Type** dropdown list, select **Date/Time**.

8. In the **Current Value** box, enter **6/1/2022** (June 1, 2022 - the VM uses US date formats).

	*While setting up the parameters, you can use an arbitrary values. Power BI will update parameter values when it creates and manages the partitions. In this lab, you'll set a range for the month of June 2022.*

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image30.png)

9. To create a second parameter, select **New**.

10. Set the following parameter properties:

	- Name: **RangeEnd**

	- Type: **Date/Time**

	- Current Value: **7/1/2022** (July 1, 2022)

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image31.png)

11. Select **OK**.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image32.png)

### Filter the query

In this task, you will add filters to the **Sales** query.

1. In the **Queries** pane, select the **Sales** query.

2. In the header of the **OrderDate** column, select the down arrow, and then select **Date/Time Filters** > **Between**.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image33.png)

3. In the **Filter Rows** window, select the first calendar icon dropdown list, and then select **Parameter**.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image34.png)

4. In the adjacent dropdown list, notice that the **RangeStart** parameter is set.

	*The default parameter selection is the correct one.*

5. In the second "range" dropdown list, select **is before**.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image35.png)

6. In the corresponding dropdown lists, select the **RangeEnd** parameter.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image36.png)

7. Select **OK**.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image37.png)

8. On the **Home** ribbon tab, from inside the **Close** group, click the **Close &amp; Apply** icon.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image38.png)

9. Notice that Power BI Desktop loaded 5,134 rows into the **Sales** table.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image39.png)

	*These are the filtered rows for the June 2022.*

10. Save the Power BI Desktop file.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image40.png)

### Set up incremental refresh

In this task, you will set up the incremental refresh policy for the **Sales** table.

1. In the model diagram, right-click the **Sales** table header, and then select **Incremental refresh**.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image41.png)

2. In the **Incremental refresh and real-time data** window, at step 2, turn on incremental refresh.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image42.png)

3. Set the following: Archive data starting **2 Years** before refresh date.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image43.png)

	*This setting determines the historical period. In this instance, Power BI will create two whole-year partitions for historic data.*

4. Set the following: Incrementally refresh data starting **7 Days** before refresh date.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image44.png)

	*This setting determines the incremental refresh period in which all rows with a date/time in that period are included in the refresh partition(s) and refreshed with each refresh operation.*

5. At step 3, check the **Get the latest data in real time with DirectQuery** option.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image45.png)

	*This setting enables fetching the latest changes from the selected table at the data source beyond the incremental refresh period by using DirectQuery. All rows with a date/time later than the incremental refresh period are included in a DirectQuery partition and fetched from the data source with every dataset query. This setting makes the table a hybrid table because it will contain import partitions and one DirectQuery partition.*

6. Select **Apply**.

	![](../images/dp500-improve-performance-with-hybrid-tables-image46.png)

7. Save the Power BI Desktop file.
